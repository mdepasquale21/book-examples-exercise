REQUIREMENTS
Given 3 integers representing the length of the sides of a triangle, return:
1 <=> equilateral
2 <=> isosceles
3 <=> scalene
throw an exception if triangle is not well formed

SMELLS
- Probably a class is overkill for this exercise, but I wanted to implement something complicated
- Tests do not require this kind of design now, but in a more general frame Triangle might be a subclass of a Shape or Polygon maybe?
- Still don't know if it is better passing an array input or 3 numbers (array easy to manipulate, 3 numbers would avoid array length problems)
- getType has a huge conditional, might require subclasses of Triangle??
